# NOSTROMO-Utils

Nostromo Utils is a Minecraft mod made for Fabric.
This mod is meant to be Vanilla-Friendly and it is meant to pair Bedrock Edition features that are missing in Java Edition.

I've also made some QOL changes to the game, such as being able to instamine deepslate and logs while using Netherite Tools and being under the effect of Haste II. You can also reactivate Sculk Shriekers using Echo Shards, which can be useful in some cases.

There are new Advancements and Secret Advancements.

DISCLAIMER: If you're planning on running this mod on a server, it needs to be both in the server files and in your mods folder.
